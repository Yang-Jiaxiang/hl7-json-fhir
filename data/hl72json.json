        "PV1":{"title":"Patient Visit","description":"The PV1 segment is used by Registration/Patient Administration applications to communicate information on an account or visit-specific basis. The default is to send account level data. To use this segment for visit level data PV1-51 - Visit Indicator must be valued to V. The value of PV-51 affects the level of data being sent on the PV1, PV2, and any other segments that are part of the associated PV1 hierarchy (e.g. ROL, DG1, or OBX)."},
        "PV2":{"title":"Patient Visit - Additional Information","description":"The PV2 segment is a continuation of information contained on the PV1 segment."},
        "OBX":{"title":"Observation Result","description":"The OBX segment is used to transmit a single observation or observation fragment. It represents the smallest indivisible unit of a report. The OBX segment can also contain encapsulated data, e.g., a CDA document or a DICOM image. Its principal mission is to carry information about observations in report messages. But the OBX can also be part of an observation order. In this case, the OBX carries clinical information needed by the filler to interpret the observation the filler makes. For example, an OBX is needed to report the inspired oxygen on an order for a blood oxygen to a blood gas lab, or to report the menstrual phase information which should be included on an order for a pap smear to a cytology lab. Appendix 7A includes codes for identifying many of pieces of information needed by observation producing services to properly interpret a test result. OBX is also found in other HL7 messages that need to include patient clinical information."},
        "AL1":{"title":"Patient Allergy Information","description":"The AL1 segment contains patient allergy information of various types. Most of this information will be derived from user-defined tables. Each AL1 segment describes a single patient allergy."},
        "DG1":{"title":"Diagnosis","description":"The DG1 segment contains patient diagnosis information of various types, for example, admitting, primary, etc. The DG1 segment is used to send multiple diagnoses (for example, for medical records encoding). It is also used when the FT1-19 - Diagnosis Code - FT1 does not provide sufficient information for a billing system. This diagnosis coding should be distinguished from the clinical problem segment used by caregivers to manage the patient (see Chapter 12, Patient Care). Coding methodologies are also defined."},
        "PR1":{"title":"Procedures","description":"The PR1 segment contains information relative to various types of procedures that can be performed on a patient. The PR1 segment can be used to send procedure information, for example: Surgical, Nuclear Medicine, X-ray with contrast, etc. The PR1 segment is used to send multiple procedures, for example, for medical records encoding or for billing systems."},
        "GT1":{"title":"Guarantor","description":"The GT1 segment contains guarantor (e.g., the person or the organization with financial responsibility for payment of a patient account) data for patient and insurance billing applications."},
        "IN1":{"title":"Insurance","description":"The IN1 segment contains insurance policy coverage information necessary to produce properly pro-rated and patient and insurance bills."},

        "OM1":{"title":"General Segment","description":"The OM1 segment contains the attributes that apply to the definition of most observations. This segment also contains the field attributes that specify what additional segments might also be defined for this observation."},
        "ORC":{"title":"Common Order","description":"The Common Order segment (ORC) is used to transmit fields that are common to all orders (all types of services that are requested). <br>The ORC segment is required in the Order (ORM) message. ORC is mandatory in Order Acknowledgment (ORR) messages if an order detail segment is present, but is not required otherwise. <br>If details are needed for a particular type of order segment (e.g., Pharmacy, Dietary), the ORC must precede any order detail segment (e.g., RXO, ODS). In some cases, the ORC may be as simple as the string ORC|OK|<placer order number>|<filler order number>|<cr>. <br>If details are not needed for the order, the order detail segment may be omitted. For example, to place an order on hold, one would transmit an ORC with the following fields completed: ORC-1-order control with a value of HD, ORC-2-placer order number, and ORC-3-filler order number."},
        "OBR":{"title":"Observation Request","description":"The Observation Request (OBR) segment is used to transmit information specific to an order for a diagnostic study or observation, physical exam, or assessment."},
        "RXA":{"title":"Pharmacy / Treatment Administration","description":"The ORC must have the filler order number and the order control code RE. As a site-specific variant, the RXO and associated RXCs and/or the RXE (and associated RXCs) may be present if the receiving application needs any of their data. The RXA carries the administration data."},
        "RXR":{"title":"Pharmacy / Treatment Route","description":"The Pharmacy/Treatment Route segment contains the alternative combination of route, site, administration device, and administration method that are prescribed as they apply to a particular order.

        "NTE":{"title":"Notes And Comments","description":"The NTE segment is defined here for inclusion in messages defined in other chapters. It is commonly used for sending notes and comments. <br>The technical committees define the meaning of the NTE segments within the context of the messages in their chapters. For each NTE, the description in the message attribute table should include an indication of the segment associated with the NTE, for example 'Notes and Comments for the PID'."},
        "SFT":{"title":"Software Segment","description":""},
        "SPM":{"title":"Specimen","description":"The intent of this segment is to describe the characteristics of a specimen. It differs from the intent of the OBR in that the OBR addresses order-specific information. It differs from the SAC segment in that the SAC addresses specimen container attributes. An advantage afforded by a separate specimen segment is that it generalizes the multiple relationships among order(s), results, specimen(s) and specimen container(s).<br>        A specimen is defined as A physical entity that is an individual, a group, an item, or a part representative of a larger group, class or whole that is the target of an observation or analysis for the purpose of drawing conclusions about the group, class, or whole. Note that any physical entity in the universe has the potential to become a specimen<br>A specimen is collected or obtained from a source and may be representative of the source, or may represent a deviation within the source. A specimen may be wholly or partially consumed during an observation and any remaining portion of the specimen is persistent and can be stored.<br>This segment may also be used in limited cases to describe a virtual specimen. In particular, to identify the characteristics required for a specimen in the context of a specific observation or test.<br>In summary, SPM represents the attributes specific and unique to a specimen."},
        "ROL":{"title":"Role","description":"The role segment contains the data necessary to add, update, correct, and delete from the record persons involved, as well as their functional involvement with the activity being transmitted.<br>In general, the ROL segment is used to describe a person playing a particular role within the context of the message. In PM, for example, in the Grant Certificate/Permission message (B07), the ROL segment is used to describe the roles a person may perform pertinent to the certificate in the message.<br>The positional location of the ROL segment in ADT and Finance messages indicates the relationship. When the segment is used following the IN3 segment, and the role-ROL value is PP or FHCP, the PP or FHCP is related to the health plan. When the segment is used following the PID segment, and the role-ROL value is PP or FHCP, the PP or FHCP is related to the person. When the segment is used following the PV2 segment, and the role-ROL value is PCP or FHCP, the PP or FHCP is related to the patient visit."},
        "MSA":{"title":"Message Acknowledgment","description":"The MSA segment contains information sent while acknowledging another message."},
        "QAK":{"title":"Query Acknowledgment","description":"The QAK segment contains information sent with responses to a query. The QAK segment may appear as an optional segment placed after the (optional) ERR segment in any query response (message) to any original mode query"},
